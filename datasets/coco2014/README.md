WARNING: `metadata.json` is  incomplete and does not fully define the COCO2014 dataset. It lacks the `recordSet` definitions that would enable automatic loading of the annotations.

`metadata.json` provides an example on how splits can be defined at the `RecordSet` level:

 - either by specifying the split name directly; 
 - or by extracting the name of the split from the file path.
