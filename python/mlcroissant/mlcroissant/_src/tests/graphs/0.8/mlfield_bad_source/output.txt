Found the following 2 error(s) during the validation:
  -  [Metadata(mydataset) > RecordSet(a-record-set) > Field(first-field)] Malformed source data: THISDOESNOTEXIST. It does not refer to any existing node. Have you used http://mlcommons.org/schema/field or https://schema.org/distribution to indicate the source field or the source distribution? If you specified a field, it should contain all the names from the RecordSet separated by `/`, e.g.: "record_set_name/field_name"
  -  [Metadata(mydataset) > RecordSet(a-record-set)] There is a reference to node with UUID "THISDOESNOTEXIST" in node "a-record-set", but this node doesn't exist.
