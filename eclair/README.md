# Your lightning-fast data scientist

Eclair is a set of agentic tools that helps AI models (like Gemini and Claude) discover, download, and use datasets to answer questions based on factual data. Today, such models struggle to discover and use structured data to answer questions, which limits their scientific and analytical potential.

With Eclair, AI models can answer your questions by easily accessing millions of datasets available all over the world, and analysing this data to give accurate answers, rather than having to guess based on training data or web searches. It's like having your own personal, lightning-fast data scientist.
