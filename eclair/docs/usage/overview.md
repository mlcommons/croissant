# Usage Overview

Eclair is designed to be flexible and accessible through multiple interfaces, each suited for different workflows and use cases. This section covers all the ways you can use Eclair to discover, analyze, and work with datasets. 

Below are usage guides for an initial set of AI agents and interfaces, but in principle any agent that supports MCP can leverage Eclair. Feel free to update this documentation with additional guides!
