## Summary

Croissant ü•ê is a high-level format for machine learning datasets that combines metadata, resource file descriptions, data structure, and default ML semantics into a single file; it works with existing datasets to make them easier to find, use, and support with tools.

Croissant builds on [schema.org](https://schema.org/), and its Dataset vocabulary, a widely used format to represent datasets on the Web, and make them searchable.

## Trying It Out

Croissant is currently under development by the community. You can try the Croissant implementation, `mlcroissant`:

Installation (requires Python 3.10+):

```bash
pip install mlcroissant
```

Loading an example dataset:

```python3
import mlcroissant as mlc
ds = mlc.Dataset("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlcommons/croissant/main/datasets/1.0/gpt-3/metadata.json")
metadata = ds.metadata.to_json()
print(f"{metadata['name']}: {metadata['description']}")
for x in ds.records(record_set="default"):
    print(x)
```

Please see the [notebook recipes](python/mlcroissant/recipes) for more examples.

## Why a standard format for ML datasets?

Datasets are the source code of machine learning (ML), but working with ML datasets is needlessly hard because each dataset has a unique file organization and method for translating file contents into data structures and thus requires a novel approach to using the data. We need a standard dataset format to make it easier to find and use ML datasets and especially to develop tools for creating, understanding, and improving ML datasets.

## The Croissant Format

Croissant ü•ê is a high-level format for machine learning datasets. Croissant brings together four rich layers (in a tasty manner, we hope üòâ):

- Metadata: description of the dataset, including responsible ML aspects
- Resources: one or more files or other sources containing the raw data
- Structure: how the raw data is combined and arranged into data structures for use
- ML semantics: how the data is most often used in an ML context

## Simple Format Example

Here is an extremely simple example of the Croissant format, with comments showing the four layers:

```json
{
  "@type": "sc:Dataset",
  "name": "minimal_example_with_recommended_fields",
  "description": "This is a minimal example, including the required and the recommended fields.",
  "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",
  "url": "https://example.com/dataset/recipes/minimal-recommended",
  "distribution": [
    {
      "@type": "cr:FileObject",
      "@id": "minimal.csv",
      "name": "minimal.csv",
      "contentUrl": "data/minimal.csv",
      "encodingFormat": "text/csv",
      "sha256": "48a7c257f3c90b2a3e529ddd2cca8f4f1bd8e49ed244ef53927649504ac55354"
    }
  ],
  "recordSet": [
    {
      "@type": "cr:RecordSet",
      "name": "examples",
      "description": "Records extracted from the example table, with their schema.",
      "field": [
        {
          "@type": "cr:Field",
          "name": "name",
          "description": "The first column contains the name.",
          "dataType": "sc:Text",
          "references": {
            "fileObject": { "@id": "minimal.csv" },
            "extract": {
              "column": "name"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "@type": "cr:Field",
          "name": "age",
          "description": "The second column contains the age.",
          "dataType": "sc:Integer",
          "references": {
            "fileObject": { "@id": "minimal.csv" },
            "extract": {
              "column": "age"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to use
* Downloading an ML dataset: Look for a Croissant file. If it doesn‚Äôt exist, ask the dataset owners for one and point them to this page.
* Loading an ML dataset for use with a model: pyTorch and TensorFlow integrations enable loading any dataset with a Croissant file and recognized data file types as follows:
* Creating or sharing an ML dataset: Create a Croissant file for your dataset starting with one of the templates here and verifying correctness using this script.
* Developing ML dataset tooling: Consider supporting Croissant as part of your tool. You can find generic loader code here (under development).
* Accepting ML dataset papers: Consider requiring Croissant files for new datasets. Help everyone by making datasets easier to find and use!

- Attend Croissant meetings (please joint the list to automatically receive the invite)
- [File issues for](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant) bugs for feature requests
- [Contribute code](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant) (please sign the MLCommons Association CLA first!)

## Integrations

- [Datasets Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com) crawls and indexes Croissant JSON-LD files on the web and provides a filter to restrict results to Croissant datasets.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) embeds Croissant JSON-LD directly in their HTML, and also provides the following ways to download the Croissant JSON-LD file:
  - Via an `Export metadata as Croissant` button on the dataset's page (ex: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness>)
  - Via download URL (ex: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness/croissant/download>)
- [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data) offers a `Croissant` button on all of their datasets to download the underlying Croissant JSON-LD file.
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) embeds Croissant JSON-LD directly in the HTML of dataset pages. It also offers ways to download the Croissant JSON-LD file:
  - Via a `Croissant` tag button on the dataset's page (ex: <https://huggingface.co/datasets/CohereForAI/aya_collection>)
  - Via their API (ex: <https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/croissant?dataset=CohereForAI/aya_collection>)
- [TFDS](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview) has a [`CroissantBuilder`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/format_specific_dataset_builders#croissantbuilder) to transform any JSON-LD file into a TFDS dataset, which makes it possible to load the data into TensorFlow, JAX and PyTorch.

## Governance

Croissant is being developed by the community as a Task Force of the [MLCommons Association](http://mlcommons.org) Datasets Working Group.
